  abstract: "The recent publication “On the quadratic variation in limit order markets” (Pani, 2024) established quadratic variation (QV) as a robust alternative to the bid-ask spread for high-resolution market microstructure analysis. Empirical findings revealed that QV from trades (29.73E-05) differs substantially from limit order book QV (68.52E-05), and that the limit-to-market (LTM) signal exhibits systematic patterns across activity levels, declining from 3.55 to 1.84 across quartiles. This position paper bridges theory to practice by identifying four high-impact application domains where these findings enable novel solutions (1) algorithmic trading and execution, where the trade-LOB QV split informs optimal execution and market-making strategies; (2) market surveillance, where QV anomalies detect manipulation; (3) intraday risk management, where multi-timescale QV improves volatility forecasting and hedging; and (4) cryptocurrency markets, where continuous QV monitoring addresses 24/7 trading challenges. We outline implementation frameworks and discuss why subsecond QV analysis has become essential in fragmented, high-frequency markets."
