  abstract: "The recent publication “On the quadratic variation in limit order markets” (Pani, 2024) established quadratic variation (QV) as a robust alternative to the bid-ask spread for high-resolution market microstructure analysis. Empirical findings revealed that QV from trades (29.73E-05) differs substantially from limit order book QV (68.52E-05), and that the limit-to-market (LTM) signal exhibits systematic patterns across activity levels, declining from 3.55 to 1.84 across quartiles. This position paper bridges theory to practice by identifying four high-impact application domains where these findings enable novel solutions (1) algorithmic trading and execution, where the trade-LOB QV split informs optimal execution and market-making strategies; (2) market surveillance, where QV anomalies detect manipulation; (3) intraday risk management, where multi-timescale QV improves volatility forecasting and hedging; and (4) cryptocurrency markets, where continuous QV monitoring addresses 24/7 trading challenges. We outline implementation frameworks and discuss why subsecond QV analysis has become essential in fragmented, high-frequency markets."

  abstract: "This paper aims to examine the dynamics of house prices in metropolitan cities in an emerging economy. The purpose of this study is to characterise the house price dynamics and the spatial heterogeneity in the dynamics. The author explores spatial heterogeneity in house price dynamics, using data for 35 Indian cities with a million-plus population. The research methodology uses panel econometrics allowing for spatial heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence and non-stationary data. The author tests for spatial differences and analyses the income elasticity of prices, the role of construction costs and lending to the real estate industry by commercial banks. Long-term fundamentals drive the Indian housing markets, where wealth parameters are stronger than supply-side parameters such as construction costs or availability of financing for housing projects. The long-term elasticity of house prices to aggregate household deposits (wealth proxy) varies considerably across cities. However, the elasticity estimated at 0.39 is low. The highest coefficient is for Ludhiana (1.14), followed by Bhubaneswar (0.78). The short-term dynamics are robust and show spatial heterogeneity. Short-term momentum (lagged housing price changes) has a parameter value of 0.307. The momentum factor is the crucial dynamic in the short term. The second driver, the reversion rate to long-term equilibrium (estimated at −0.18), is higher than rates reported from developed markets. This research applies to markets that require some home equity contributions from buyers of housing services. Stakeholders can characterise stable housing markets based on long-term fundamental value and short-run house price dynamics. Because stable housing markets benefit all stakeholders, weak or non-existent mean reversion dynamics may prompt the intervention of policymakers. The role of urban planners, and local and regional governance, is essential to remove the bottlenecks from the demand side or supply side factors that can lead to runaway prices. Existing literature is concerned about the risk of a housing bubble due to relaxed credit norms. To prevent housing market bubbles, some regulators require higher contributions from home buyers in the form of equity. The dynamics of house prices in markets with higher owner equity requirements vary from high-leverage markets. The influence of wealth effects is examined using novel data sets. This research, documents in an emerging market context, the observations cited in low-leverage developed markets such as Germany and Japan."

  abstract: "This paper examines the strengths, opportunities, and challenges presented by the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) product/service from the perspective of the consumer, service providers, investors, and regulators. We present a microeconomic model of BNPL consumers and firms. The model and simulation to the model highlight the strength of the BNPL product. In its simplest form, the deferred payment of consumer purchase, the product is robust and attractive to all stakeholders."

  file_path: "https://doi.org/10.1504/IJFMD.2021.114782"
  category: "Journal Article (2021)"
  abstract: "This paper investigates, in high resolution, the role of liquidity in a limit order market. Liquidity in these markets has two parts - a liquidity store and liquidity flow (time dimension). We model the liquidity residing in a limit order book and the liquidity flow from the latent order book, using a fully probabilistic model. Using a sample of stocks from NASDAQ 100, we find that liquidity residing in the order book within five levels each on either side of the transaction price and the flow to this liquidity pool from the latent order book can explain the wealth traded through the trading system, when observed in business time. The explanatory power is satisfactory in high resolution and short periods of business time but weaker in aggregated longer time periods. We observe that the liquidity pool for a large part of the trading day goes into a steady state equilibrium."
